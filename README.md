# dydxbot
This is an application for placing trades on the dYdX decentralised exchange automatically.
A market making strategy has been implemented whereby a buy order is placed slightly below the current mid-market price and if this order is executed, then a sell order is placed slightly above. The spread between them is enough to cover fees and make a small profit.

### Warning
